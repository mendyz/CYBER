add a word list that we think might be the password (aka word lists and dicts)
word list ->add then choose the rules (lower or upper case add year or month and a into @ etc) and max and min size

sniffs network and cracks, caches and keys, recover wireless network keys

may get a firewall warning, mostly for the networking things
network sniffing, arp poisoning, password cracking, mitm
sniff
configure network, sniffer choose device, start sniffer (in the icons), blue plus icon 
all hosts and let it scan MAC addresses, under the sniffer tab you can remove any of the MAC it found. Can resolve them via right click to resolve hostnames.
ARP poisoning
click the nuclear yellow icon to start arp posining
firewall will complain
move to cracker tab to start cracking passwords
choose from the side the password type, here NTLM
plus to add hashes from file or from the local system via checkbox
can use the custom wordlist, first choose the hased you want to crack in the cells by highlighting them and right clicking
choose ntlm wordlist (can also choose many more like, brute force, rainbow, etc) 
choose to add workdlist for the dict attack, can choose extra options (aka rules) case, adding things, l33t etc. start and wait in that popup.
will add the password to the main screen when done. Can keep using different dicts in that popup.
Then use brute force when done with the dict, as it takes longer to run so don't do it on everyone of them.

John the Ripper
On a windows machine, the hash files work best when they are in the same john RUN folder.
cmd in the desktop folder, cd into secrets (remember that DIR is used instead of ls, with cd .. and cd and use tab completion)
Copy Windows.txt C:Users/Administrator/Desktop/Secrets C:Users/Administrator/Desktop/Tools/John179\run
change into the john run folder and run the app with \john179\run
then tell it we want to use the file with: john Windows/txt
it will tell you how many it loaded in and some stats on the hashes.
then start guesses, it can take time (in this case let it run for at least 5 minutes)
To crack this particular type of information, John will look at the password.lst file located in the john179 directory and compare the hash values in the dump file (in our case, the Windows.txt file) with the calculated hash values for the words contained in the password file. If there’s a match then John the Ripper will list the passwords it finds at the command line. If, after attempting to do a quick hash comparison on all the accounts, if there are any uncracked passwords John the Ripper will then roll into another form of attack to crack the passwords.
CTRL C can stop the tool
LINUX
Prep Tool Module for Cracking
To get started on cracking the zip file you have to first use the zip2john script to grab the hash of the password used, and then put that hash into a separate file (in the case below the file will be secret.hash). To do this, open a terminal and enter the following command:
./zip2john Secret.zip > secret.hash
List the first five characters in the hash value (after pkzip2$):
to see them run nano secret.hash

Now ue john to crack using a word list
./john secret.hash –wordlist=password.lst
show the passwords with ./john -show secret.hash
use unzip with the filename to unzip this one and use the cracked password
eog imagefilename.jpg to open image files
libreoffice filenames.docx to open the document files and pdf files use "" for any names with spaces in them.
use cp to copy files over, when pulling multiple files use a space between files then the destination folder after all of them. Can use tab auto completion on the file names. destination start with /home/student/then the folder names
create the hash ./office2john.py Premiere.xlsx > premiere.hash
now use john to crack it
./john premiere.hash –wordlist=password.lst
to show the passwords use ./john -show premier.hash

order is mostly 
find the zip sor files that need passwords or encryption passwords for the files
move them into john run folder
create the hash by running ./office2john.py FILE.EXTENSION > FILE.HASH
use john to show the hashes and other info on the programs and details ./john -show FILENAME
then use john to crack them with ./john FILENAME.hash –wordlist=password.lst
use that to open the files
